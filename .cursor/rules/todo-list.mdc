# TODO List Management Rule

Whenever you start a new task or complete a task, you must:

1. Check the current state of the [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md) file.
2. Update the TODO list to reflect the new task's status (e.g., mark as complete, add new items, or update progress).
3. When marking a TODO item as complete or in progress, add a reference to the relevant code change, commit hash, pull request, or file path if possible. This creates a clear audit trail linking TODOs to actual code changes.
4. Ensure that the TODO.md file is always up to date with the actual progress and changes in the codebase.

**Automation Guidance:**
- Whenever a code change directly addresses a TODO item, automatically update the TODO.md with a reference (e.g., `(Completed in commit abc123)` or `(See src/components/Foo.tsx)`).
- If a TODO item is split into subtasks or moved, update the TODO.md to reflect the new structure and add references as needed.

This rule ensures that the TODO list remains a reliable, traceable, and actionable source of project status and priorities.
