# Task Implementation Guide

When a user sends a task:

1. Check the [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md) file to see if the task is listed as incomplete (marked with `[ ]`).
2. If the task exists in the TODO list and is incomplete:
   - Analyze the current codebase to understand what implementation is needed
   - Provide a realistic, complete, and ready-to-go implementation
   - Include all necessary imports, proper error handling, and follow existing code patterns
   - Make sure the implementation is consistent with the project's architecture and styling
3. After implementing the feature, update the TODO.md file to mark the task as complete and add a reference to the relevant changes.
4. If the task requires multiple files or complex changes, break it down into manageable steps and implement them sequentially.

Remember to commit changes after marking a TODO item as complete, following the commit-on-task-complete rule.
