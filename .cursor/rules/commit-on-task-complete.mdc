# Commit on Task Completion Rule

Whenever you mark a TODO item as complete in [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md), you must:

1. Make a git commit immediately after updating the TODO.md file.
2. The commit message should reference the completed task, ideally quoting the TODO item or summarizing it (e.g., `Mark TODO complete: Add calendar view for events`).
3. If possible, include a reference to the relevant code changes, file paths, or PR numbers in the commit message for traceability.

This rule ensures that every completed task is tracked in version control, providing a clear history of project progress.
